Additional notes:

This website was built using ReactJS, so a basic understanding of ReactJS and its components would be helpful in understanding the code.

The website has five main pages: Home, Services, Fares, About Us, and Contact Us. You can access each of these pages from the navbar.

The website also has a toggle button to switch between light and dark mode. You can find the toggle button in the navbar.

The website uses React Router to handle the routing of the pages. You can find the routing logic in the App.js file.

The website uses Bootstrap for its styling, and the CSS files can be found in the src folder.

Feel free to modify the code and experiment with the website.
